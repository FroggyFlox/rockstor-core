# What is Rockstor?

Rockstor is a Network Attached Storage (NAS) solution built on Linux and the B-Tree
Filesystem (BTRFS). It is written in Python and Javascript and is made
available as a complete Linux distribution for convenience. Rockstor takes NAS
to a new level with advanced features, ease of use, and management. It goes
beyond traditional NAS by supporting Docker based apps, RESTful APIs; and serves as a
powerful cloud storage platform out-of-the-box.

# What are the project goals?

The main goal is to develop an easy to deploy and use open source NAS solution for
for commodity hardware. For more information, see:
[Our Endeavour](http://rockstor.com/about-us.html).

# Who should use it?

Rockstor aims to aid individuals and organisations alike. As a DIY setup some
familiarity with PC/Pi4 operating system install is required; but not much beyond
the basics. For more information please see our main web site:
